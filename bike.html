                <h2>MOTOR INSURANCE</h2>
                <span><!-- line here --></span>

                <p>Our standard motor insurance or the so-called motor insurance policy is usually administered as the insurance coverage mandated by law to drive on the road. It’s primarily to cover the vehicle against any liability damages and unexpected repairs.</p>

                    <p>Unlike just covering for the damages we offer a range of other utilities to the policy holders, as follows</p>
                   
                    <p>-->claims at network garages <br></p> 
                    <p>-->Depreciation cover <br></p> 
                    <p>-->protection cover <br></p> 
                    <p>-->24X7 road side assistance <br></p> 
                    <p>-->Towing facility <br></p> 
                    
                <p>Cashless Claim settlement – This is the best part of our insurance policy, more like that of an health insurance, with a number of garages across the country providing the Cashless Claim Settlement. By figuring the nearest garage, the repairing claim can be done with contacting the insurer. Just incase the towing service is also being provided at conditions when a drive through is not being possible.</p>
